## Description

The social network api is a demonstration of MongoDB in action. This is an application that allows you to create new users, post thoughts for that user, and react to those thoughts with subsequent comments.

Users can add other users as friends to their friend list, and interact with each other's comments.

Finally, users, thoughts, reactions, and friends can all be deleted from the database.

## Demonstration
The below video shows the API routes in action using Insomnia Core.
